# gnss_fuser

## Purpose
The `gnss_fuser` node subscribes to GNSS messages from two sensors (one mounted on the left side and one on the right side) and calculates a fused GNSS position representing the midpoint between the two sensors. This setup is fixed and described in the sensor configuration.
